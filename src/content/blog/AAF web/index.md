The Alliance of American Football was a professional league founded by Charlie Ebersol and Bill Polian. The AAF began the inaugural season on February 9, 2019. The league was scheduled to have a 10-week regular season and conclude with a championship game on April 27. After eight weeks of play, however, the league's football operations were suspended by controlling owner Thomas Dundon on April 2. The league offered fans an immersive digital experience where they could interact with the game on a play-by-play level. During gametime, the web platform offered fans the ab ability to view the game from the camera of their choice as well as a digitally simulated top-down view to track each player. Between games, the web platform offered standard features such as stats for players, teams, league, standings, and allowed fans to purchase tickets and merchandise.

### The Setup

The web team was assembled 2 weeks before the kickoff of the season. I was hired to design the end-to-end experience. The interactive platform had to be built out iteratively through the season.

### Problem V1

The prompt was brought to me in a big, vague manner.
“We need a new web platform. Right now there’s janky WP site that only sells tickets. It needs to also sell merchandise and broadcast the game. It also needs to host some player tracking that the fans can play with during the game. Also, team ops need to use the platform for their stuff. Let’s not worry about that yet.”

My interpretation: the platform will have 2 modes, one for gametime and one in-between.



The success of the platform will be measured on

- Tickets sold per game
- Merchandise sales per week
- Average session length during games

### Research

There was not a lot of time to run a full user research process. I digested prior research from the larger organization and filled in a few gaps by sitting in bars during NFL games, reading sports blogs, and speaking to my sports fanatic friends. I relied on references from existing sports platforms on the assumption that they’ve dedicated significant efforts into user research. Looked for similarities in key areas:

- Layouts, especially the use of above-the-fold real estate
- Navigation
- Common functionality and user flows of each
- Call-to-action placement

### Execution

I mapped out the full user flow and created spreadsheets to detail the data from the back end. I worked with my PM to prioritize functionality and features based on:

- User impact
- Technical feasibility or readiness
- Time required for implementation



From there, a pared-down user flow with just the information architecture was given to the engineers to start building.



There was no time for low-fidelity. I turned my focus to high fidelity right away. I synced up with the designers on the mobile team on what I could pull from the design system and which components I should look to be adding on the web side.
